# The Case for McKesson Adopting Blockchain Technology

## Overview and Origin
McKesson Corporation [MCK](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=MCK&qsearchterm=mck) is a publicly traded, Fortune 8 company founded in 1833 by Charles Olcott and John McKesson.<sup>1,2</sup> McKesson's business holdings have ebbed and flowed over the decades, but currently operates as the largest healthcare products distributor in North America. While many may see McKesson's size and 187 years of operations as a sign of strength, history has shown that such companies are also **ripe for disruption**.

This case study will focus on one specific aspect of the healthcare distribution operating model: Pharmaceutical Contract Pricing. 

## The Competitive and Operational Landscape:

McKesson is one of three major pharmaceutical wholesalers in the United States, which distribute ~92% of all medications.<sup>3</sup> Its business units are organized into four reporting segments<sup>4</sup>:
### U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions

- Prescription Technology Solutions (RxTS)
- International 
- Medical Surgical Solutions
-- McKesson's business unit supplying non-Rx medical equipment and supplies to non-acute customers, that is, outside a hospital setting.
