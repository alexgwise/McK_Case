# The Case for McKesson Adopting Blockchain Technology

## Overview and Origin
McKesson Corporation [MCK](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=MCK&qsearchterm=mck) is a publicly traded, Fortune 8 company founded in 1833 by Charles Olcott and John McKesson.<sup>1,2</sup> McKesson's business holdings have ebbed and flowed over the decades, but currently operates as the largest healthcare products distributor in North America. While many may see McKesson's size and 187 years of operations as a sign of strength, history has shown that such companies are also **ripe for disruption**.

This case study will focus on one specific aspect of the healthcare distribution operating model for McKesson and its competitors: Pharmaceutical Contract Pricing. 

## The Competitive and Operational Landscape:

McKesson is one of three major pharmaceutical wholesalers in the United States, which distribute ~92% of all medications.<sup>3</sup> Its business units are organized into four reporting segments<sup>4</sup>:

- U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions

Comprising over 80% of McKesson's revenue, Pharmaceutical and Specialty solutions is comprised of distribution sales to Health Systems, Retail Pharmacies, Specialty Clinics, and Long-Term Care facilities. As of its last earnings release, McKesson expects this segment to experience 3% to 6% growth this fiscal year.<sup>5</sup>

- Prescription Technology Solutions (RxTS)

McKesson's Rx Technology Solutions division hosts a suite of complimentary software systems and services for its customers. Major products include Relay Health, a 50,000 pharmacy prescription payment network, CoverMyMeds which assists pharmacies and doctors with prior authorization confirmations for prescriptions, and RxCrossroads, offering patient assistance programs and adherence solutions.<sup>6,7,8</sup>

- International
